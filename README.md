# BAS-explorsion

BAS is a novel optimum algorithm, which show faster convergence speed 
BAS.py includes a standard BAS 
BAS_values.py includes two improved BAS, BAS_value and BAS_gra

BAS_value applies the combination of gradient (exactly two directional derivatives) and average decline.

ax^{2} + by^{2} + c = 0
